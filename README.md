# TDD-Example
This repository demonstrates the basics of a concept called Test Driven Development(TDD). 

##TO RUN THE BMI CALCULATOR
Ensure you are on a machine that has python installed. 
On Windows right click and run the file. 
On Linux navigate to the appropriate directory in the terminal and enter "python main.py"
Be careful as there is no error detection. Cheers!

##TO RUN THE TEST PROGRAM
Ensure you are on a machine that has python AND pytest installed.
(To install pytest on linux run "pip install -U pytest")
You may be able to type "pytest --version" to check this depending on your machine. 
If both are installed ensure you are in the directory of the files and
use "pytest test_main.py -v". 

#####AS A DISCLAIMER
This program works well on Linux. It was built there. The program and test program are compatible with linux if both are installed. ON THE OTHER HAND there were no requirements to ensure that the test program could run with pytest on windows. Therefore proceed with caution when trying to install pytest on windows. In VScode in the powershell you may be able 
to pip install pytest.
